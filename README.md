# WordPress plugin for Excalidraw

This plugin allows users to create and edit Excalidraw documents directly in the WordPress backend. Using an Excalidraw block for Gutenberg, the drawing can be easily inserted into posts. On the frontend, the drawings are displayed as SVG files, reducing page load time and making images responsive.

## Adding a new drawing

Is as simple as adding a new block in the Gutenberg editor.
